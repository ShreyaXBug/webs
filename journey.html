    <p> <br><br><br>   The idea of a flower bouquet website emerged from a passion for floral arrangements, elegance, and creativity. The goal was to provide a platform that offers beautifully curated flower bouquets, making gifting and decorating effortless.
<br>
         Brainstorming Names
        The team explored multiple name ideas that reflected freshness, nature, and charm. Some of the early name ideas included:
        <br>
        Petal Bliss <br>
        Flora Haven <br>
        Bloom Essence <br>
        The Blossom Crate <br>
        The team wanted a name that was simple, aesthetic, and memorable while representing the beauty of flowers. <br><br><br>
        
         The Final Name: The Bloom Box <br>
        After several discussions, "The Bloom Box" was chosen because: <br>
        &check; "Bloom" represents the fresh, vibrant flowers. <br>
        &check; "Box" symbolizes packaging, making it perfect for a flower delivery concept. <br>
        &check; The name is catchy, easy to remember, and gives a premium feel. <br><br>
        
        4Ô∏è Branding & Aesthetic <br>
        With the name set, the team moved on to designing a logo, choosing a soft, elegant color palette (like pastel pinks, greens, and whites), and curating the perfect floral arrangements for the website.
